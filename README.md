# Demand Forecasting Case Study

## Overview
Demand forecasting is a critical business problem for many product-based organizations. It plays a vital role in achieving sales targets while effectively managing inventory. This case study focuses on real-life data from the technology industry, providing time series data regarding the number of units purchased on a monthly basis. The primary objective is to develop a robust forecasting model capable of accurately predicting demand for the next 12 months.

## Data
The provided data is stored in the CSV file named \`Forecasting_Case_Study_Data.csv\`. It contains monthly unit sales data with the following columns:

- **Time:** Fiscal month for which units data is recorded.
- **Actuals:** Units sold in the respective fiscal month.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to construct a forecasting model that can accurately predict the units sold for the next 12 months based on historical data. The dataset spans 42 months, providing a sufficient amount of time series data for analysis and model development.

## Approach
To address the problem statement, the following steps will be undertaken:
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the provided dataset to understand patterns, trends, and seasonality.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, if any, and format the data for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features that may influence demand forecasting.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with different forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like LSTM or XGBoost.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the selected model to achieve optimal performance.
7. **Forecasting:** Deploy the finalized model to forecast demand for the next 12 months.
